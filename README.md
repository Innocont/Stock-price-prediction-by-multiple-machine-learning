# Stock-price-prediction-by-multiple-machine-learning
通过多种机器学习股票价格预测，包括随机森林(Random Forest),决策树(SVM),线性回归(LinearRegression),长短期记忆(LSTM)。
## 数据获取与数据集说明/Data acquisition and dataset description
利用toshare获取600519.sh 2000-2020年数据，除了随机森林外基本都是以前19年数据做训练集，最后一年做预测。
数据获取的文件在toshare文件夹，数据集一并在内。自己注册toshare换接口即可<br>
Use toshare to obtain the 2000-2020 data of 600519.sh. Except for the random forest, the data of the previous 19 years is basically used as the training set, and the prediction is made in the last year.
The files of data acquisition are in the toshare folder, and the data sets are included together. You can register toshare yourself to change the Token.
## 其他补充/supplement
这些内容都是结课实践要求下我搜集网络资料学习而来，自己理解修改整理使得基本以同一个数据集进行预测。可以说对国内网络上参差不齐的简单机器学习股票预测做了一个复现整理。<br>
这对我的机器学习知识有一定帮助，也希望能帮助到需要它的人。<br>
These contents are all learned from the collection of online data under the requirements of the completion of the course. I understand and modify it to make predictions based on the same data set. It can be said that a recurring arrangement has been made on the uneven simple machine learning stock predictions on the domestic network. This has helped my machine learning knowledge to some extent, and hopefully will help someone who needs it.
